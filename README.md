# E-commerce Sales Analysis - Excel

This repository contains the Excel report on "E-commerce sales analysis"

In this project, we explore an organization's online transactions. The raw data comprised of sales,returns,Row id,order id,ship date etc.

After a thorough data cleaning and exploratory analysis, it became clear that there are several ways to analyze the data.

*The main purpose of the analysis is to explore consumer behavior and how e-commerce companies can increase their sales accordingly.

#### WHAT I HAD TRIED TO ACHIEVE:-

1) Which areas are huge markets for our products to better target the customers?

2) Which product do people commonly buy in a particular state as this would help us understanding the consumer behaviour and then we can give offers and discounts only on the product that people will mostly prefer to buy rather than giving it to random products.

3) Which type of transactions do people prefer for the payments?
